A CSV reader.
A type <map> is what I use for my projects.
So that is the output it gives.
It reads it as a vector orginally so that is a possible output also.


To open a CSV file
CSV csv;
csv.open("titanic.csv");


To get data
csv.get_map();  // returns a <map> with header file as keys
csv.get_vector(); // returns 2 dimensional <vector>



TODO
Currently it expects the first line to be a header.
Handing of empty values in CSV needs to be looked at.
